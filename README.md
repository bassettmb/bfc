### Submitted by Team

#### High Priority
1. As a project manager, I want to be able to port a brainfuck codebase into C
2. As a brainfuck developer, I want the compiler to check for code correctness
3. As a brainfuck developer, I want the compiler to produce useful error messages

#### Medium Priority
1. As a project manager, I want any ported code to be optimized for efficiency
2. As a brainfuck developer, I want an option to automatically compile any generated C code into an executable

#### Low Priority
1. As a project manager, I want to be able to port a brainfuck codebase into multiple languages
2. As a brainfuck developer, I want to be able to choose between different optimization levels when compiling my code
3. As a brainfuck developer, I want the tool to include a REPL to interpret and run brainfuck code on the fly
